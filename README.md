# Typography and Color Scheme
The fonts I chose are Federant and Merriweather. Federant is very similar to the Star Trek font which keeps the game on theme due to the addition of the Spock element. I also chose the color scheme based on a color palette created from Star Trek main colors. These colors are vibrant and eyecatching to grab the attention of the user.
