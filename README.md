# Features
## Star Trek themed Title
The title is in a vibrant red which draws the users attention. It is also in the font Federant to inkeep with the theme of the game space.

![RPSLS Title](https://github.com/Josephine2244/PP2-Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock/assets/137813807/66dde22f-34a7-4ae5-a0ba-39e6bd2f227b)

## Rounds Won Counter
The game is first to score 5 points wins the round. The round counter keeps track of how many rounds the user has won.

## Interactive Game Area
The game area displays the players choice and the hosts choice clearly in text and with a symbol to ensure ease of play. All sections have a different colour font to emphasise the different features of the game.

![Players choices](https://github.com/Josephine2244/PP2-Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock/assets/137813807/3b7d490e-654e-46be-9e90-4d45a78682ba)

## Players choice buttons
There are 5 buttons for the player to make their choice with. Each button has the text and a symbol representing what they stand for. The buttons are brightly coloured to draw attention and the text is black to ensure plenty of contrast to make it easily legible.

![Buttons area](https://github.com/Josephine2244/PP2-Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock/assets/137813807/4d3069c8-aff1-4ece-b53c-1ed2367e79a7)

## Results
The results area displays either 'Better Luck Next Time.' or 'You Win!' depending on the outcome of the game. This means players are not having to constantly check the rules to see who has won if they are not familiar with the rules before playing.

## Scoreboard
There is a scoreboard at the bottom of the game area so the player can keep track of their wins and losses.

![Score Area](https://github.com/Josephine2244/PP2-Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock/assets/137813807/47764f0c-53ae-4b91-9618-4279715b1473)

## Reset Button
At the bottom of the game area I have included a reset button so players can reset the score and start again without having to refresh the page.

![Reset Button](https://github.com/Josephine2244/PP2-Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock/assets/137813807/eef61e10-c34f-4b70-abe3-49dbfeca3b11)

## How to Play Section
This section contains an image explaining how the symbols interact with eachother. The background color and title help the page flow from the game section to the how to play section.

# Future Features
- Multiplayer: The ability to play with another person (online or using the same device) instead of always playing the computer.
- Different difficulty levels: Easy (original rock, paper, scissors), Medium (Current game), Hard (add more icons and rules).

# Typography and Color Scheme
The fonts I chose are Federant and Merriweather. Federant is very similar to the Star Trek font which keeps the game on theme due to the addition of the Spock element. I also chose the color scheme based on a color palette created from Star Trek main colors. These colors are vibrant and eyecatching to grab the attention of the user.

- Background image was too bold and made it hard to read the text. I added an overlay to dull the image and make the text more legible.
- Made the buttons bigger to make the writing legible and the symbol more visible.
